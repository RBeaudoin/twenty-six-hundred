#Twenty Six Hundred

An Atari 2600 emulator in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

##Overview

The best way to learn a new language is to build something. I decided to write this to learn Rust while simultaneously getting some experience writing an emulator.

##Project Status

This is currently a work-in-progress as I make my way through learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and the internals of the Atari 2600 hardware.

UPDATE 03-01-2016: I'm currently focused on emulation of the [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6507)
